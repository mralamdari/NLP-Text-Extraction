# NLP-Regular-Expression-Practice


Have you ever 
I have gathered some movie names from a dataset
and have made some changes in their names so they can't be spelled correctly, for example:
I have added URLs, put dots between words, add some pixels and extra, like these:

1. Venom.Let.There.Be.Carnage.2021.1080p.mkv
2. Wonder.Woman.1.2017.720p.Farsi.Dubbed-[RubixFa.com].mkv

Now, I want to correct their names, so they can be like these:

1. Venom Let There Be Carnage (2021).mkv
2. Wonder Woman 1 (2017).mkv

As you can see, they look much better this way.

So I'm gonna use Regular Expressions to correct all of them at once,
by some lines of codes.

I have two good reason's to do this job automatically:

1. I will learn Regular Expressions in the process because RegEx is very useful in NLP.
2. I can make my life easier.

I hope you find it useful too.
